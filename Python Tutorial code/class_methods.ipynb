        "A class method is a type of method that is bound to the class and not the instance of the class. In other words, it operates on the class as a whole, rather than on a specific instance of the class. Class methods are defined using the \"@classmethod\" decorator, followed by a function defination. The firt argument of the function is always \"cls\" which represents the class itself.\n",

        "***Why use python class methods?***\n",
        "\n",
        "Class methods are useful in several situations. For example, you might want to create a factory method that creates instances of your class in a specific way. Yor could define a class method that crates the instance and returns it to the caller. Another common use case is to provide alternative constructors for your class. This can be useful if you want to create instance of your class in multiple ways, but still have a consistent interface for doing so.\n",

They are useful for creating factory methods, alternative constructors, and other types of methods that operate at the class level. With the knowledge of how to define and use class methods, you can start writing more complex and organized code in python."
